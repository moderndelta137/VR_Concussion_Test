So it makes me thinking, why not put them together to make an awesome game.\r\n\r\nFor years we've been dreaming to wield a lightsaber or fight dragons with a legendary sword. Although it's difficult to accomplish this in the real world, but in virtual reality, everything is possible. Especially with the Hydra controller which is a magnetic field tracker capable of tracking the position and orientation of the user's hand.With the powerful UE4 implementing the Hydra into VR environment has never been easier.\r\n\r\nSo here we precent the project S.A.O. which stands for Sword Art Outside, a real sword fighting game I used to play with my friends using harmless foam weapons. This game aims to recreate the realistic experience of sword fighting. In this game attack is more than just pressing buttons. You can slash in whatever direction you want. With UE4's destructible mesh we can create a highly interactive game with intuitive control system. There will be dozens of weapons to choose from. You will be able to parry enemy's attack, deflect laser blaster bolt, or even perform sophisticated sword skills. And there's more to come.\r\n\r\nThe game is currently under development and it's fully open sourse. The recent progress will be updated on the Github page.\r\n###To play the demo: \r\nUnity3d Pro is required to build the project.\r\nOculus and Wii Balance Board are Required. \r\n\r\n+ Connect the Wii Balance Board to the computer using Bluetooth.\r\n+ Set experiment parameters in the /Assets/Input/Parameters.xml file.\r\n+ Run the program and follow the instructions.\r\n+ Collect data from the /Assets/Output/ folder.\r\n\r\n###To view the source code: \r\nThis project is not open-sourced. Authorization is required to view the source code.\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nProgrammer: Dun Mao\r\nExperiment Design: Dr. Sang-Hoon Yeo\r\n\r\nPlease do not use this work for commercial purposes, thank you.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
